summary: "<code>asreml</code>-R fits a model by estimating the variance components using REML approach with the average information (AI) algorithm (Johnson and Thompson, 1995). This method was popularised and implemented in the stand-alone program ASreml (Gilmour et al., 1995) which is widely used, in particular by breeders.  An interface for R was written based on the core algorithm in the stand-alone program, which we refer to as asreml-R (Butler et al., 2009). The <code>asreml</code>-R package is a powerful R-package to fit linear mixed models, with one huge advantage over competition is that, as far as I can see, it allows a lot of flexibility in the variance structures and more intuitive in its use.

## Data: Wheat Yield Trial
```{r, message=F, warning=F, render=F, results='hide', echo=F}
library(asreml)
library(myf)
library(plotly)
library(tidyverse)
data("nin89")
```
The data is originally from Stroup and Baenziger (1994) that is included as <code>Wheat2</code> in <code>nlme</code> and as <code>nin89</code> in <code>asreml</code>.


```{r, message=F}
nin89 %>% ggplot(aes(Row, Column, fill=Rep)) + geom_tile() + ggtitle("Replicate Block")

p <- nin89 %>% ggplot(aes(Row, Column, fill=Variety)) + geom_tile() + ggtitle("Variety Plot") 
ggplotly(p)
```

## Fitting the linear mixed model in R

We want to the following model to the yield $\boldsymbol{y}$:
$$y=\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\tau} + \boldsymbol{Z}\boldsymbol{u} + \boldsymbol{e}$$
where $\boldsymbol{X}$ is the design matrix for the fixed variety effects $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ and $\boldsymbol{Z}$ is the design matrix for the random Block effect $\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\boldsymbol{e}$ is a vector of random error. We assume that 
$$\begin{bmatrix}\boldsymbol{u}\\
\boldsymbol{e}
\end{bmatrix}\sim N\left(\begin{bmatrix}\boldsymbol{0}\\
\boldsymbol{0}
\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}\sigma^2_b\boldsymbol{I}_4 & \boldsymbol{0}\\
\boldsymbol{0} & \sigma^2\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_c \otimes\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_r
\end{bmatrix}\right)$$
where $\sigma^2\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_c$ and $\sigma^2\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_r$ are autoregressive process of order one for column and row direction, respectively. 

We can fit the above model in <code>asreml</code>-R as below.
```{r, results='hide'}
m0 <- asreml(yield ~ Variety, random=~Rep, rcov=~ar1(Column):ar1(Row), data=nin89, na.method.X="include", na.method.Y="include", aom=T)
asreml.variogram(x=1:nrow(nin89), z=m0$aom$R[,2]) %>% ggplot(aes(x, gamma)) + geom_point() + 
  theme_bw(base_size=16) + xlab("Unit Lag") + ylab("Empiricial Variogram for Stud. Cond. Residual")
```
Most programs struggle to fit a multiplicative autoregressive structure as above. Is it important to fit such a structure though? Let's assume instead that ${\rm var}(\boldsymbol{e}) = \sigma^2 \boldsymbol{I}_{242}$. 

```{r, results='hide'}
m1 <- asreml(yield ~ Variety, random=~Rep, rcov=~id(Column):id(Row), data=nin89, na.method.X="include", na.method.Y="include", aom=T)
asreml.variogram(x=1:nrow(nin89), z=m1$aom$R[,2]) %>% ggplot(aes(x, gamma)) + geom_point() + 
  theme_bw(base_size=16) + xlab("Unit Lag") + ylab("Empiricial Variogram for Stud. Cond. Residual")
```

We can clearly see that there are some spatial trend that is not well captured by the second model. 

## A little about asreml-R


<code>asreml</code>-R fits a model by estimating the variance components using REML approach with the average information (AI) algorithm (Johnson and Thompson, 1995). This method was popularised and implemented in the stand-alone program ASreml (Gilmour et al., 1995) which is widely used, in particular by breeders.  An interface for R was written based on the core algorithm in the stand-alone program, which we refer to as asreml-R (Butler et al., 2009). The <code>asreml</code>-R package is a powerful R-package to fit linear mixed models, with one huge advantage over competition is that, as far as I can see, it allows a lot of flexibility in the variance structures and more intuitive in its use.

The competing, alternative R-packages that fit the linear mixed models are <code>nlme</code> and <code>lme4</code>. Luis A. Apiolaza makes a comparison of these packages in [his blog dated 2011/10/17](http://www.quantumforest.com/2011/10/linear-mixed-models-in-r/). One downside is that <code>asreml</code>-R requires a [license](https://www.vsni.co.uk/software/asreml/). This may be provided for free for educational or research purposes (details of which I am not aware of). Here is an attempt for the [question dated 2011/11/01](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/18709/lme4-or-other-open-source-r-package-code-equivalent-to-asreml-r) to recreate the same analysis as <code>asreml</code>-R, although it appears spatial models (i.e. AR1$\times$AR1) cannot be easily recreated in open source packages. The dates are a bit old so perhaps the current situation may be different.
