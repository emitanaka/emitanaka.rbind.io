This blog is where I host my trivial musings. I'm more of a listener in life. I like to learn. Blogging or being public doesn't come naturally to me but I think sometimes i have something worthwhile to share. Sometimes.  

My main website is hosted [here](https://emitanaka.github.io/). My main website is listed as one of the impressive `blogdown` websites in the [R Markdown: The Definite Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics-examples.html#examples-websites) but there are plenty of [great ones out there](https://github.com/rbind).

This website was built using the R package `blogdown` using the Hugo theme `minimo`.
